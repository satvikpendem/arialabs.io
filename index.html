        <span id="description">
          Aria Labs is your software solutions agency. <br />We use a three-step
          plan to understand your problem, identify any roadblocks and issues
          hindering you, and get the best people on our team to solve your
          problems.

          <h3>Talk with You.</h3>
          <span>
            We provide a free consultation to figure out exactly what you need.
            Along the way, we’ll discover the roadblocks and discuss any
            pitfalls that may be stopping you currently. Don’t worry, we
            understand your pain.

        <section id="step-two">
          <h3>Assemble your Team.</h3>
          <span>
            Unlike most agencies, we hire experienced individuals for each
            individual project instead of keeping them on staff. This way, we
            can fully prioritize the best people to work with your individual
            requirements rather than have employees that may not completely
            mould to your needs.

        <section id="step-three">
          <h3>Solve your Problem.</h3>
          <span>
            Expect weekly updates and feedback, regular milestones, and direct
            access to the team should you have any questions and ideas.
